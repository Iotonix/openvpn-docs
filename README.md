This repository provides a comprehensive guide for installing and configuring OpenVPN on mobile devices, specifically targeting trucks, tugboats, backhoes, and other vehicles commonly used in industrial settings.

## Motivation

At IOTONIX, we're passionate about enabling seamless data connectivity for our customers' fleets, regardless of their location or the challenging environments they operate in. This documentation is designed to empower our clients to easily establish secure connections between their mobile assets and the IOTONIX IoT platform using OpenVPN.

By following these instructions, you'll be able to:

- **Securely transmit telemetry data:** Ensure the confidentiality and integrity of critical data collected from your trucks, tugboats, and other equipment.
- **Remotely monitor and manage assets:** Gain real-time insights into the performance and location of your fleet, enabling proactive maintenance and optimized operations.
- **Enhance operational efficiency:** Streamline data collection and analysis, leading to improved decision-making and increased productivity.

This guide is specifically tailored for installations on devices operating in environments with limited or intermittent connectivity, such as:

- **Trucks:** Long-haul trucking, construction, and logistics.
- **Tugboats:** Marine transportation and harbor operations.
- **Backhoes:** Construction sites and earthmoving operations.

We believe that by providing clear and accessible documentation, we can help our customers unlock the full potential of their IoT deployments.

## Why OpenVPN?

While cloud-based VPN solutions and proprietary VPNs offer convenience, OpenVPN stands out as our preferred choice due to its exceptional balance of cost-effectiveness and robust security. By leveraging OpenVPN's open-source nature and flexible configuration options, we empower our customers to establish secure connections without incurring the recurring costs associated with proprietary solutions. This approach ensures that businesses of all sizes can benefit from enterprise-grade security and reliable connectivity while maintaining control over their VPN infrastructure.
